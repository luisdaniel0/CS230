## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Creative Technology Solutions wanted to develop a web-based version of the Draw It or Lose It game for The Gaming Room. I did well laying out the requirements and constraints that this kind of project would entail. 

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through a design document is most helpful when coding as it helps you organize which tasks are important and require more attention than other ones. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the evaluations because I received a lot of outside help on that part since I didn't understand. I feel like I have a better understanding of it now where I can evaluate the
characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating platform.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took into account the user's needs and implemented multiplayer support, web-based and cross-platform accessibility real-time rendering, and asynchronous communication.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Thoroughly understanding user needs and project requirements outlined in the executive summary. Identifying key features and constraints, such as multiplayer support, uniqueness, web-based architecture, and security considerations.
Offering actionable recommendations, such as opting for cloud-based platforms, microservices architecture, and secure storage solutions.
Aligning development tools with platform-specific expertise and user requirements.
